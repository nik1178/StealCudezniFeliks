# German in Čudežni Feliks
This program was made to get all the german phrases from the book "Čudežni Feliks".
It works by getting all the text from the book which has been scanned entirely, then checking every word, to see if it matches any of the words in the german dictionary.
The program outputs the scanned words into one file, and the sentences containing german into another file.
